      question: "How does device leasing work?",
      answer: "Our device leasing process is easy: select your device, choose your lease term (monthly, 12, 24, or 36 months), and we'll deliver it to your door. You pay a fixed monthly fee throughout your lease term. When your lease ends, you can return the device, upgrade to a newer model, or in some cases, purchase the device at a discounted price."
    },
    upgradeDevice: {
      question: "Can I upgrade my device during my lease?",
      answer: "Yes! We offer flexible upgrade options. If you're on a monthly lease, you can upgrade anytime. If you're on a longer-term lease, you can upgrade after a minimum period (typically 6-12 months, depending on your plan) by returning your current device in good condition and starting a new lease."
